# UNIT 
### Create two different implementations of a Fibonacci number generator:
1. Recursive Implementation: Write a function that uses recursion (the function calls itself) to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
2. Iterative Implementation: Write a function that uses loops to calculate the nth Fibonacci number without recursion.
